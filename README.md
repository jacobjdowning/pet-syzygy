# Pet Syzygy

A web application that calculates when the Squirt pet trainer will be up in the Garrison during a Pet Battle Bonus Event in World of Warcraft. The Calendar that has the dates for the Pet Battle Bonus Event is not available via the Blizzard Web API so in tools there is an in-game addon and a converter lua script to update a JSON file of the dates.
